This repository contains the Latex files required to compile
a set of graduate level lecture notes on Plasma Physics. 
These notes were authored by Prof. Richard Fitzpatrick 
(Department of Physics, University of Texas at Austin).

The files will only compile properly when the following
standard Latex packages are installed:

fullpage
epsf
rotate
charter
euler
fancyhdr

The document can be compiled by issuing the command

latex Plasma

in the base directory (containing Plasma.tex).

The document will need to be compiled at least three times to
update all of the internal references, and to generate the
table of contents data.
